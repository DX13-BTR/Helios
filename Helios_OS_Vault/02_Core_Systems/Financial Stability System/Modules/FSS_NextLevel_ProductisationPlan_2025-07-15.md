# 🚀 Financial Stability System – Productisation & Daily Spend Optimiser Plan

This document outlines the next-stage transformation of the Helios Financial Stability System (FSS) from a financial tracking engine into a productised daily money coach, with savings goal logic, live advisory feedback, and nudging behaviour.

---

## 🧱 Phase 1 – Purpose-Driven Spending

### 🎯 Goals
- Track spending against goals, not just categories
- Make it clear what’s helping vs hurting goal progress

### ✅ Features
- Goal tagging for merchants (`neutral / blocking / contributing`)
- Deadline-driven targets (e.g. £500 buffer by 31 Oct)
- Weekly "progress against plan" feedback
- Adjustment suggestions if goal is at risk

---

## 🧠 Phase 2 – Dynamic Advice Layer ("Money Coach")

### 🎯 Goals
- Provide live, contextual feedback
- Encourage better decisions **before** money is spent

### ✅ Features
- Weekly/daily insights (e.g. "OK to spend £25 on extras today")
- Goal catch-up suggestions
- Delay-or-cut logic: "delay £50 expense until 25th"
- Savings accelerators: "move £30 now to hit goal faster"

---

## 💰 Phase 3 – Savings Engine (SavingsGoalsPlanner)

### 🎯 Goals
- Convert financial headroom into structured, goal-aligned savings
- Ensure targets are met gradually over time

### ✅ Features
- Create multiple goals (name, target, deadline)
- Suggest weekly contribution for each
- Prioritise short-term and time-sensitive goals
- Show progress (e.g. Week 3 of 16, £45 planned, £30 actual)
- Alert when behind schedule

---

## 📊 Phase 4 – Visual & UX Layer

### 🎯 Goals
- Make insights intuitive, emotionally resonant, and clear at a glance

### ✅ Features
- Top 5 merchants by spend (bar chart)
- Essential vs discretionary breakdown (donut)
- 90-day discretionary spend trend (line)
- Forecast heatmap calendar
- Dynamic colour-coded banners: Safe, Warning, Overspend

---

## 📬 Phase 5 – Habit & Feedback Loop

### 🎯 Goals
- Reinforce behaviour via nudging and streak-based reinforcement

### ✅ Features
- Daily Safe-to-Spend prompt
- Weekly digest (last week’s spend, savings, forecast)
- £0-spend day tracker
- "No Takeaway Week" streaks
- Optional: auto-transfer leftover money to savings

---

## 🧩 Phase 6 – Modularisation & Productisation

### 🎯 Goals
- Prepare FSS as an installable or client-deployable product

### ✅ Features
- Toggle for multiple users (Mike / Tee / client mode)
- Sheet→Dashboard port with export pack
- Optional deployment via web app (readonly or advisory)
- Settings tab: savings rules, UC limits, nudging preferences
- Export button (HTML / PDF snapshot)

---

## 🔁 Immediate Implementation Priorities

1. `generateSpendingAdvice()` – actionable weekly insights
2. `SavingsGoalsPlanner()` – named goals with contribution logic
3. Dynamic dashboard prompt banners (Safe / Warning / Suggest)
4. Chart overlays to dashboard (`Top Merchants`, `Spend Breakdown`)
5. Weekly digest automation (summary + recommendation delivery)
