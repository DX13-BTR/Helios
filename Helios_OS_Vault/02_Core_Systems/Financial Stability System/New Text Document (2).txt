🚩 Efkaristo Financial Stability System Build – Current Progress
Overall Objective:
To stabilise Efkaristo Ltd’s financial flows, ensuring:
✅ Predictable, consistent monthly director pay for Mike & Teresa.
✅ Alignment with Universal Credit (UC) assessment periods:

11th–10th each month (payment on 17th).
✅ Building buffer reserves for VAT, PAYE, CT, and emergencies.
✅ Long-term aim to accumulate a property deposit while maintaining quality of life.
✅ Reduce financial stress and admin friction in managing personal and business cash flow.

✅ Modules Built or Partially Built:
1️⃣ UC Planner:
UC period tracking confirmed: 11th–10th, payment 17th.

Aims to model optimal payment timings for salary/dividends to maximise UC without breaching thresholds unnecessarily.

Currently mapped manually; automation pending.

2️⃣ Director Pay Engine:
Captures net business cash position.

Calculates safe, sustainable draw amounts while preserving required buffers.

Intended to move from ad-hoc pay patterns to 2 structured payments/month for each director.

Currently tracked manually.

3️⃣ Buffer Logic:
Logic drafted to ensure:

VAT allocation set aside from each payment.

PAYE set aside.

CT set aside.

Surplus confirmed before non-essential or discretionary spending.

Partial manual tracking in spreadsheets.

4️⃣ Drawdown Planner:
Models drawdown amounts against upcoming obligations.

Will integrate with payment readiness dashboard for visibility.

Currently conceptual, pending build.

✅ Current Related Progress:
Expense Improvement Plan underway (reducing SaaS bloat, inefficient spend, subscriptions, hardware overspend) to free cash for stable director pay.

Preparing to align payment runs with UC planning:

Two structured payment dates each month for Mike & Teresa.

Consistent approach for smoother UC calculation and reduced admin.

✅ Next Priorities for the Build:
1️⃣ Automate the UC Planner to show live safe draw amounts vs. UC thresholds.
2️⃣ Activate structured payment workflow to align with the planner outputs.
3️⃣ Integrate buffer logic dynamically with real cash positions.
4️⃣ Deploy in Helios OS/ClickUp/Notion or lightweight dashboard for daily/weekly visibility.
5️⃣ Continue to prune expenses to optimise available drawdown capacity.

🪪 Constraints:
Mike and Teresa are on UC and need stable income but must manage thresholds.

Desire to maintain a quality of life while building towards a property deposit.

Business cash flow can be lumpy; stability is the primary goal before aggressive savings.

✅ Outcome:
The system will ensure:
✅ Predictable pay.
✅ Alignment with UC.
✅ Buffer protection.
✅ Clarity on available cash vs. obligations.
✅ Reduced financial stress.

🚀 What is needed from the DPM thread next:
✅ Build the next logical step in the Financial Build pipeline:

Automate UC Planner with structured input/output.

Link structured payment run templates aligned with this logic.

Begin live tracking and adjustment integration with Expense Improvement wins.
