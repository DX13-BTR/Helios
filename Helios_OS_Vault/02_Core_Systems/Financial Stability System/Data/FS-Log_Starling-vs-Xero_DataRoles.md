# üß≠ Starling vs Xero ‚Äì Ingestion and Decision Layer Roles

## ‚úÖ Summary

The core of the Financial Stability System will be built on **Starling transaction-level data**, not just balances.

While Xero was originally considered for ingestion, it's now confirmed that:

- Starling will act as the **real-time financial source of truth**
- Xero will act as a **contextual cross-reference** (e.g. category labels, reconciled view)

---

## üß† Why Starling Takes Priority

- Direct live access to personal + business bank accounts
- API gives:
  - üîÅ Transaction feed (`/feed-items`)
  - üí∞ Account + space balances
  - üè¶ Transfers between accounts/spaces
- Enables:
  - üîé Detection of recurring bills from real historical spend
  - üßÆ Real-time UC-safe drawdown limits
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Future spend simulation based on past behaviour

---

## üßæ Why Xero Is Still Useful (But Not Primary)

Xero‚Äôs role is *not* for live balance or spending data, but to:

- Provide **meaning/context** to spend (via nominal accounts)
- Enable **reconciliation insights**
- Act as a **bookkeeping sanity-check layer** (e.g. is Starling tagged correctly?)
- Possibly inform tax planning, PAYE cycles, or forecasted obligations

> Xero = ‚ÄúWhat the transaction means‚Äù  
> Starling = ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs actually happening‚Äù

---

## üîí Locked-in Principle

> **We will not build manual bills trackers, budgets, or static operating buffers.**  
> Instead, we will analyse real historical Starling transaction behaviour to:

- Detect recurring bills
- Project expected spend
- Define actual safe drawdown recommendations

---

## ‚úÖ Immediate Next Step: Starling Transaction Feed Build

### Build: `fetchStarlingTransactions()`  
Pull raw transaction history via Starling `/feed-items` or `/transactions` endpoint for:

- Efkaristo Ltd account
- Personal account

---

## üß© Then:

1. **Normalise transactions**
   - Identify payees
   - Match patterns (amount + day of month)
   - Group into categories (e.g. rent, utilities, food, subscriptions)

2. **Detect expected upcoming outgoings**
   - Predict bills due in next 14 days based on history
   - Use this to calculate realistic drawdown ceiling

3. **Replace balance-only planner**
   - Use transactional forecast in drawdown logic
   - `safeToDraw = available cash ‚àí forecasted spend ‚àí UC buffer`

---

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Future (Optional Later):

- Add Xero reconciled transaction feed for accuracy checking
- Add ‚Äúexplain this transaction‚Äù layer using Xero‚Äôs nominals
- Sync back drawdowns into Xero (optional advisory feature)
