# ✅ FS-BuildSnapshot – 2025-07-15

## 🎯 Primary Outcome  
**Automated Daily Forecast & Drawdown Engine operational**, generating reliable financial insight from Starling data via Google Sheets + Apps Script.

---

## 🛠 What Was Built or Refined

| Component | Summary |
|----------|---------|
| **Starling Transaction Import** | ✅ Pulled 180-day history, then transitioned to daily sync. |
| **Recurring Transactions Engine** | ✅ Identified repeating income/expenses with estimated frequency and next-due projections. |
| **Forecast Sheet** (`Forecast_90DayDaily`) | ✅ Generated 90-day forward forecast of recurring transactions. |
| **Tee Payment Logic** | ✅ Locked in £650/month as top-priority non-negotiable outgoing. |
| **Drawdown Planner** (`DrawdownPlanner`) | ✅ Calculates weekly safe drawdown amount after Tee + forecasted bills. |
| **Starting Balance Integration** | ✅ Pulls live balance from `DailyMetrics` to inform drawdown range. |
| **Scheduled Triggers** | ✅ Time-based automation for fetch → cleanup → forecast → drawdown pipeline (2AM–7AM). |
| **Risk Flag System** | ✅ Flags weeks as 🔻Shortfall / ⚠️ Low Buffer / ✅ Safe. |
| **Master Automation Function** | ✅ `runDailyPlanner()` executes all required logic in order. |

---

## 💡 Observations

- Tee’s payment is now immovable and calculated *before* anything else.
- Drawdown logic works **with live balance**, not assumptions.
- Starling and Obsidian now **cleanly decoupled** — Google Sheets is primary processing layer.
- Insight now possible *without manual updates*, for the first time.

| **3** | **Spending Optimiser** | Start surfacing wasteful or frequent transactions. |
| **4** | **Savings Goal Engine** | Calculate how much can be transferred to spaces weekly. |

📌 **Next Action:**
Mike to confirm next priority (e.g. visualisation, savings logic, director pay optimisation) before continuing forecast module layering.
