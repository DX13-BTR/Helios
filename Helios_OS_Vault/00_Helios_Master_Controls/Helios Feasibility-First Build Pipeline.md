# Helios Feasibility-First Build Pipeline

## Purpose
To ensure that all Helios and system builds are vetted for feasibility, capacity, and alignment with Efkaristo’s operational realities before committing valuable build time, protecting client delivery while driving systemisation forward.

---

## Pipeline Stages

### 1️⃣ Capture Idea/System Need
- Log the idea, system improvement, or module to be built.
- Note the intended benefit (time saving, consistency, scalability).
- Place in “Build Ideas” capture list in ClickUp or Obsidian.

---

### 2️⃣ Feasibility Check
- Is the system technically possible with your current tools/stack?
- Does it require research or external validation before build?
- Are there regulatory or compliance considerations?
- Outcome: ✅ Feasible | 🕒 Needs Research | 🚫 Not Feasible Now

---

### 3️⃣ Capacity Check
- Can this build be executed in your current 90m protected slots without harming client delivery?
- Does it require splitting across multiple slots?
- Is this the *highest impact build* for your current context?
- Outcome: ✅ Proceed | 🕒 Park for later

---

### 4️⃣ Build Planning
- Break the build into clear, manageable steps.
- Identify dependencies (other builds, tools, data).
- Define success criteria: “Done means ___.”
- Estimate how many 90m slots will be needed.

---

### 5️⃣ Execution & Testing
- Execute the build within protected slots.
- Test functionality, reliability, and fit with current workflows.
- Log blockers and learnings for refinement.

---

### 6️⃣ Deploy/Integrate
- Integrate the build into your operational workflow (ClickUp, Motion, etc.).
- Notify Teresa (or future team members) if relevant.
- Create usage SOP if needed.

---

### 7️⃣ Review & Iterate
- After using the system for 1-2 weeks, review:
   - Is it delivering the intended benefit?
   - Are adjustments required?
- Update the system or pipeline as needed for stability.

---

## Governance Rules

✅ No build should enter your protected 90m slots unless it has passed Stages 1–3.  
✅ Use Feasibility-First Pipeline before committing to any multi-slot Helios build.  
✅ If stuck on feasibility, schedule a *dedicated feasibility check slot* before continuing.

---

## Next Step

- Apply this pipeline to your **first Helios/system build candidate**.
- Log findings and feasibility outcomes in your Obsidian vault or ClickUp for tracking.
