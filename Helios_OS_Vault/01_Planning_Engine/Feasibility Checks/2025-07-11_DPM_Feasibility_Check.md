## ðŸ“Œ Project Update: Director Pay Module (DPM)

âœ… We ran a **Feasibility-First Check** on the **Director Pay Module/app** to stabilise director pay, align with UC, and improve tax efficiency.

### ðŸŸ© Decision:

**Proceed with Phase 1 MVP build for immediate use.**

---

### **Scope of Phase 1 MVP:**

âœ… **Calculates optimal director salary** (gross/net) based on:

- Personal allowance
    
- NIC thresholds
    
- Corporation tax efficiency
    
- Universal Credit taper
    

âœ… **Outputs salary figures** for **manual input into Employment Hero** or any payroll system (no payslip generation required in-app).

âœ… **Calculates and tracks dividends** aligned with cashflow and tax efficiency.

âœ… **Generates dividend vouchers automatically** (no RTI required).

âœ… Uses **Google Sheets + ClickUp task triggers** for ease of use and workflow integration.

âœ… Structured for **manual transference now, with future API integration in roadmap** for Employment Hero, Xero, BrightPay, etc.

### **Why MVP is chosen over plan first:**

- Allows **immediate practical use** for stabilising July/August pay cycle.
    
- Enables real-world feedback to refine structure before Helios modular build.
    
- Keeps momentum on financial stability system while remaining lightweight.
    
- Easier to iterate into Helios and future productisation later.

### ðŸŸ© Next:

ChatGPT will build the **Phase 1 DPM MVP immediately** and deliver:

- Google Sheet with inputs/outputs
    
- Dividend voucher generation template
    
- ClickUp intake workflow template
    
- Simple instructions for consistent monthly use
    

so Mike and Teresa can begin using it for this monthâ€™s director pay.
