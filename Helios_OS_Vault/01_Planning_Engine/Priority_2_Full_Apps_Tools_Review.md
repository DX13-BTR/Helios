# Priority 2: Full Apps & Tools Review

## Purpose
To systematically review all apps, software, and tools currently used within Efkaristo, ensuring we are maximising their utility, eliminating waste, and leveraging existing paid features before considering new purchases.

## Objectives
- Identify every tool/app in use, including those used infrequently.
- Assess actual usage versus intended usage.
- Identify underutilised features that could replace manual processes.
- Highlight potential cancellations or consolidations for cost/time savings.
- Document integrations with current workflows (ClickUp, Motion, Google Workspace, Reclaim, Pipedream, etc.).

## Next Action
- Draft a complete list of all apps/tools currently in use for review.
- Assign status (Essential, Useful, Underused, Unused, Potential Cancel).
- Review in your next protected build slot.
