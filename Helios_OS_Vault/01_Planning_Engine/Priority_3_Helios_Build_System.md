# Priority 3: Helios Build System

## Purpose
To systematically build and deploy Helios and its supporting modules in a sustainable, structured way that improves the operational stability and scalability of Efkaristo, while protecting client delivery and your personal bandwidth.

## Objectives
- Create a Feasibility-First Build Pipeline to vet all builds before execution.
- Establish protected build slots for consistent progress without overwhelm.
- Break down Helios into modules and clear phases, with dependencies mapped.
- Align builds with systemisation goals (reducing manual work, improving consistency).
- Enable potential future scaling of Efkaristo without chaos.

## Next Action
- Draft the Helios Feasibility-First Build Pipeline structure for discussion.
- Identify the first Helios module to test the pipeline.
- Schedule during your next protected build slot.
