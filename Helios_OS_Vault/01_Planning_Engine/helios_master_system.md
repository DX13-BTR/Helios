# Helios OS v8.0 – Master System Overview

## 📌 Purpose
To build Helios OS as an internal operating system for Efkaristo Ltd — optimising financial stability, operational excellence, and time freedom — with future potential to offer Helios as a productised platform for other accountancy practices.

---

## 🧭 Strategic Direction
- **Primary Goal:** Improve Mike & Teresa’s business and life via automation, clarity, and financial predictability.
- **Secondary Goal:** Position Helios as a future resaleable system for other practices (white-label ready).

Helios is not a replacement for other apps (ClickUp, Reclaim, Xero, etc.), but a unifying intelligence layer that brings them together into one fluid operating system.

📌 Position Helios as:
- A workflow engine *not a PM replacement*
- Automation & insight layer for practices using ClickUp/Senta/Karbon/BrightManager etc
- Flexible: Keep Reclaim/ClickUp OR layer over Monday, Trello, etc.
